1.Data Source
From Data scraped on Kickstarter

2.Feature Engineering
Explain the process and rationale behind the feature engineering:
Description of Features:
Supportiveness, Video_in_description, DescriptionLength, DescriptionSentiment, DescriptionClarity, etc.
Briefly describe what each feature represents and how it was computed.
Pre-processing Steps:
Data cleaning techniques applied, such as handling missing values or outliers.
Any transformation applied to the data (e.g., normalization, categorical encoding).

3.OLS Regression Analysis
Detail the steps and results of the OLS regression analysis:
Describe the process of building the OLS regression model, including the selection of dependent and independent variables.
Key Findings:
Summarize the main outcomes of the regression analysis. Highlight significant coefficients and their implications.
Discuss the model's overall fit (R-squared value) and any statistical tests performed.
Interpretation:

4.Provide insights on how the features impact the dependent variable.
Discuss any surprising or counterintuitive findings.

Future Work
Proposals for more complex analytical approaches or addressing any limitations in the current analysis.
